**Project Overview** 
The Intrusion Detection System with Explainable AI (IDS-XAI) is a machine learning-based cybersecurity solution designed to detect malicious activity and intrusions in 
a computer network. The project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and explainable AI techniques to not only identify potential threats but also provide clear 
and interpretable reasons behind each detection, ensuring transparency and trust in the systemâ€™s decisions.
Introduction
This project aims to enhance traditional intrusion detection systems by incorporating explainable AI (XAI) to interpret and visualize the decision-making process of the machine learning model. By making the model's predictions more understandable, users can verify the reasons behind flagged intrusions and trust the system in real-world scenarios.

**Goals**
1. Detect network intrusions with high accuracy.
2. Provide interpretable explanations for each detection.
3. Improve decision transparency in cybersecurity applications.

**Features**
1. Real-time Intrusion Detection: Monitors network traffic for unusual patterns and potential threats.
2. Explainability: Uses XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to explain the reasoning behind each classification decision.
3. Customizable: The system can be fine-tuned to detect specific types of intrusions based on network characteristics and traffic data.
4. Integration Ready: Can be integrated with existing security systems for automated alerting and response.
   
**Technologies Used**
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.
Explainable AI: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment: Flask (for creating a web interface), Docker (for containerization)

**Getting Started**
Follow these steps to get the system running locally:

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Anaconda or virtual environment (optional but recommended)
Git

2. Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Intrusion-Detection-System-with-Explainable-AI.git
cd Intrusion-Detection-System-with-Explainable-AI
Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) If you're using Docker, you can build the container:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t ids-xai .
Data
The dataset used in this project contains network traffic logs with labeled intrusion data. You can find the dataset at Kaggle's NSL-KDD dataset or any other suitable network traffic dataset.

**Data Preprocessing**
Link to the dataset: url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defcom17/NSL_KDD/master/KDDTrain+.txt"

Data is cleaned and preprocessed by removing irrelevant features, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Explanation
This project employs a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify normal and malicious network traffic.

The model is then augmented with explainable AI techniques like:


LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): Provides a local explanation by approximating the model with an interpretable surrogate model.
These methods help security analysts understand why a specific traffic pattern was flagged as malicious.
